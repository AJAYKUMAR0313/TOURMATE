OPERATIONAL ERRORS
->problems that we can predict will happen at some point,so wee just need to handle them in advance
ex:
->invalid path accessed
->invalid user input
->failed to connect to the server
->failed to connect the db
->request timeout

we use GLOBAL ERROR HANDLING MIDDLEWARE to catch all ther errors


PROGRAMMING ERRORS
->Bugs that we developers introduce into our code.Difficult to find and handle
ex:
->reading properties on undefined
->using await without async
->passing a number where object is expected
->using request.query instead of req.body
